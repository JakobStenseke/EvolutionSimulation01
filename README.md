# Evolution Simulation 01

![](EvolutionGIF.gif)



A ruthless evolutionary simulation where agents move, age, reproduce, perceive, and eat each other. Alternatively put - a continuous exercise in metastability problem mitigation.

<b>• Strength</b> - Agents can eat other agents of lesser strength

<b>• Health</b> - Decreases every day. If 0, the agent starves to death. Agents increase health by eating other agents.

<b>• Rage</b> - Likelyhood of attacking another agent (and eat them if their strength is greater)

<b>• Sexuality</b> - Probability of reproduction (with another agent of the other gender)

<b>• Perception</b> - Likeleyhood of moving towards another agent

<b>• Age</b> - Agents die of a certain age
